Flow variable - measures aggregation over time
Stock variable - continuous/instantaneous measurements

decomposition models - Models we use to study time-series data
Additive decomposition models - y = Trend + Seasonality + error
Multiplicative decomposition models - y = Trend * Seasonality * error
Log multiplicative decomposition models - log y = log (Trend) + log (Seasonality) + log(error)

Why take the log of multiplicative decomposition model? - Taking the log permits use of the usual statistical methodology for analyzing data with a multiplicative decomposition model. 

When to use the additive model - when volatility does not change as the response level increases
When to use the multiplicative model - when variance of y increases as the level of response increases (i.e. when we can see volatility increase as y increases)

Changes - multiplicative model addresses percentage changes in y, whereas additive model deals directly with level changes.

Key assumptions:
	- Seasonal component: non-random and periodic. Periodic meaning that seasonal components repeat exactly.
	- Trend component: non-random.
	- Disturbance component: random, have mean 0 and constant variance, are uncorrelated and are normally distributed.

Static structure - exactly periodic structure 
Dynamic structure - seasonal pattern which evolves over time
